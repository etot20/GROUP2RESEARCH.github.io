            Tableau is an analytics solution that allows users to connect, analyze, and share their data. The software started as a visualization tool, growing into an enterprise platform with several deployment options until they were acquired by Salesforce in 2019. Today, its products are plugged into the greater Salesforce ecosystem and compete with Tableau alternatives like Looker, Sisense, or Qlik.

With Tableau, users can connect all their data sources and use visualizations alongside some of Salesforce’s Einstein capabilities to see trends and outliers in their data and make predictions about their business. For a long time, Tableau was a favorite for users who preferred a drag-and-drop interface for creating charts and visualizations—today some of its data management and [cloud billing] capabilities make it more of an enterprise IT tool.
